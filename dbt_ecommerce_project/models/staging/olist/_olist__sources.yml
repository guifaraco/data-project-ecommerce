                This dataset has information about the customer and its location. Use it to identify unique customers in the orders dataset and to find the orders delivery location.

                At our system each order is assigned to a unique customer_id. This means that the same customer will get different ids for different orders. The purpose of having a customer_unique_id on the dataset is to allow you to identify customers that made repurchases at the store. Otherwise you would find that each order had a different customer associated with.

                ### Example:

                The `order_id = 00143d0f86d6fbd9f9b38ab440ac16f5` has 3 items (same product). Each item has the freight calculated accordingly to its measures and weight. To get the total freight value for each order you just have to sum.

                **The total order_item value is:** `21.33 * 3 = 63.99`

                **The total freight value is:** `15.10 * 3 = 45.30`

                **The total order value (product + freight) is:** `45.30 + 63.99 = 109.29`
